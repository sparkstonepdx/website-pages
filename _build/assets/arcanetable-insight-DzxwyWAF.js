Fast forward to present day, and we live on opposite ends of the country but we still try and keep in touch.  My wife surprised me for my birthday in 2024 by flying my friend out to spend the week with us."}),`
`,t(e.p,{children:"We got pretty deep back into Magic the Gathering while he was here, and it made me realize a massive hole in the market.  He headed back home after the visit, and I started writing code on a new pet project,  I wanted to be able to mess around with cards the same way we did when in person, but without needing to constantly pay for plane tickets, and that didn't seem to exist.  After several months of sleepless nights and a desire to code that I hadn't experienced since working on those small games in my youth, we were able to both join the same session and see each other moving cards around!  We played a couple sessions over the next couple weeks, and then I got back to the real world and got back to building products for Sparkstone and eventually forgot about Arcanetable."}),`
